Nomic: The GitHub Edition 
=========================

Nomic is a game wherein the point is to change the rules of the game. The
[original paper](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm) goes to great
depths explaining just why this is a fun and worthy use of time. Everyone should
at least make a stab at reading that. This file is in 
[GitHub-flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)

Immutable Rules 
---------------

**101** All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the
form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in
effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116
(immutable) and 201-214 (mutable).

**102** Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are
mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from
immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of
their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of
their numbers.

**103** A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or
amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an
amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into
a mutable rule or vice versa.

(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new rules are
mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable, may not be amended or
repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are mutable, may be amended or
repealed; any rule of any status may be transmuted; no rule is absolutely immune
to change.)

**104** All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will
be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.

**105** Every player is an eligible voter. 

**106** All proposed rule-changes shall be written down before they are voted
on. If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were
voted on.

**107** No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion
of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No
rule-change may have retroactive application.

**108** Each proposed rule-change shall be given a number for reference. The
numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change proposed in the proper way
shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is
adopted.

If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of the proposal to
reenact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it receives the number of the
proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, the
entire rule of which it is a part receives the number of the proposal to amend
or repeal the amendment.

**109** Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be
adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters.
Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a proposal
to take effect.

**110** In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the immutable
rule takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void. For the
purposes of this rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule does not
"conflict" with that immutable rule.

**111** Other players may suggest amendments or argue
against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this
debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be
voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to
end debate and vote.

**112** The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from
achieving n points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of n and the
means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when
play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or
repealed.

**113** A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue
to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment
of the player to incur it, may be imposed.

**114** There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of
rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.

**115** Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule-changes are
as permissible as other rule-changes. Even rule-changes that amend or repeal
their own authority are permissible. No rule-change or type of move is
impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
rule.

**116** Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and
unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted
only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.

Mutable Rules 
-------------

**201** Players may take their turn at any time, independent of other players. 
All players begin with zero points.

**202** One turn consists of proposing one rule-change and having it voted on.

**203** A rule-change is adopted if and only if at least a simple majority
of the players votes in favour of the rule-change.

**204** An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion
of the vote that adopted it.

**205** When a proposed rule-change is adopted, the player who proposed it
gains 1 point.

**206** Each player always has exactly one vote.

**207** The winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points.

**304** If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or
more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the following steps must be
followed to resolve the conflict:
 1. If only one of the numbers of the conflicting rules is prime, the prime rule takes precedence.
 2. Else if the length of only one of the numbers of the conflicting rules when converted to words (using
 [this](http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/conversions/numberstowords.php) is of prime length, the rule with this
 property takes precedence.
 3. Else the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it
defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule
(or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the method above for
determining precedence.

If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to
one another, then the method outlined above again governs.

**210** If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation
or application of a rule, then the player with the Github handle alphabetically
previous to the player who started their turn first amongst all players
currently taking turns is to be the Judge and decide the question. 
Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be
created by the insistence of any player. This process is called invoking
Judgment.

When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or her turn
without the consent of a majority of the other players.

The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other
players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled,
then the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge
for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his or
her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.

Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the
game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own
legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.

New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may,
however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and
that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All
decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect;
but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue,
then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before
applying other standards.

**211** If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the
legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best
reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the
player who proposed the last adopted rule wins.

This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.

**212** A rule-change is proposed by submitting a pull request, such that
merging the pull request reflects the accurate state of the game after
adoption of the rule-change.

**213** A non-player can become a player by submitting a pull request which adds
their name and Github handle to the Player List.

**214** A player can vote on a rule-change by commenting on the pull request
with a comment that includes the word **vote** in bold. A commit on a pull
request dated after any votes resets those votes.

If the rule-change is adopted, a player who can shall merge the pull-request
in a timely fashion, which marks completion of the vote.

**302** If a PR that outlines a rule-change contains `y` commit hashes containing an English dictionary word of at least
four consecutive letters, the proposer will be awarded `y` additional points when the PR is merged.

An English dictionary word is defined as a word found in the Oxford Dictionary available
[here](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/). The default search setting of Eng (UK) is to be used as a search criterium.

Points are only awarded if the proposer includes the `y` points in his update of his score and mentions this explicitly
in his PR.
